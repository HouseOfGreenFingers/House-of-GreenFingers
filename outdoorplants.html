                <p>If you grow lots of annual flowers, you are familiar with the annual chores necessary to maintain such beds:  you purchase flower seedlings (or start your own), and plant them. You nurture them throughout the growing season, fertilize and water them; then, when the season's over and the plants die, you pull them out. Next year, the cycle begins anew.<br> 
                   Perennial plants remain in the ground year after year. Once established, many perennials need minimal upkeep in the form of watering and fertilizing, since their roots are more far-ranging than annual plantsâ€™ roots. Many perennials spread readily, filling out garden spaces and providing more and more color each year. <br></p>
