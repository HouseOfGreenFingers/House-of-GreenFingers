             <p>One of the First Choices to decide when buying a plant is where you want it to be located in your home. This is a very important consideration when purchasing your plant. Many plants have specific environments that they would consider ideal and others that would not be suitable. Whether the space is sunny or in the shade can all be factors to consider when choosing the right plant for you. Remember your plant doesn't just have to be decorative or flowering you can also choose to grow herbs or some kinds of veg. The choice is up to you. </p>
